 * Base URL (optional).
 *
 * If @It's Just Code is generating incorrect URLs on your site, which could
 * be in HTML headers (links to CSS and JS files) or visible links on pages
 * (such as in menus), uncomment the Base URL statement below (remove the
 * leading hash/pound sign) and fill in the absolute URL to your @It's Just Code installation.
 *
 * You might also want to force users to use a given domain.
 *
 * Examples:
 *   $base_url = 'http://www.example.com';
 *   $base_url = 'http://www.example.com:8888';
 *   $base_url = 'http://www.example.com/rjournal';
 *   $base_url = 'https://www.example.com:8888/rjournal';
 *
 * It is not allowed to have a trailing slash; @It's Just Code will add it
 * for you.
